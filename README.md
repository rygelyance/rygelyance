# Hi, I'm Rygel!

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland: College Park, and I'm pursing a double BS in Computer Science and Mathematics, with specializations in Machine Learning and Statistics! During the summer of 2024, I was an undergraduate research intern for UMD's Immersive Research Internship Experience (IRIE).

I've always been interested in tech and its capabilities, and with harware becoming more and more powerful and specialized, the need for more capable software is at an all-time high. I'd like to one day play a role in leveraging what's possible with technology while making it reliable and easy to use.

## Tools
These are the main tools and languages that I have used and learned through both personal projects and academia.
